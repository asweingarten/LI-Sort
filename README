REST Web-App Template
============================

Based on code from a project by Ariel Weingarten, Utkarsh Sanghi, Mark Roukema, and Gulshan Singh for the 2013 LinkedIn Hackathon.

# Backstory
On an internship I worked extensively with Backbone.js and I enjoyed it.
I wasn't in charge of any of thecore application logic nor the backend. This left me familiar with how an application layer worked, but not with how to hook it up to a backend.
I spent a great deal of time looking for a comprehensive tutorial and came up short. 
Now that I've created a bare bones REST app, I'm going to write the tutorial I wish I had. 

Here are the main topics that I'm going to cover:
  -Application layer -- Backbone.js
  -Persistence layer -- PHP REST Server on top of a mysql server
  -Frontend          -- Very basic HTML and styling using Twitter Bootstrap
  
These topics will be broken into several modules.

After I complete the tutorial, I will convert the javascript to coffee script in a follow-up mini-series
